<h1>What is AI</h1>
<p>AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It's the field of computer science focused on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and learning from experience. AI enables machines to perform tasks that would otherwise require human input, making them more efficient, accurate and reliable.</p>

<h2>Why is AI useful</h2>
<p>Efficiency: AI can process vast amounts of data at a much faster rate than humans. This means that it can make decisions and analyze data in real-time, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.Accuracy: AI algorithms are designed to be highly accurate. They can make predictions, detect anomalies, and identify patterns with a high degree of accuracy.Automation: AI can automate repetitive and monotonous tasks, freeing up humans to focus on more complex and creative tasks.Personalization: AI algorithms can analyze data on individual users and personalize experiences based on their preferences and behavior.Scalability: AI can be used to scale operations and analyze data across large organizations, enabling businesses to make more informed decisions at a much larger scale.</p>
